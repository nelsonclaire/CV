## Work Experience

**Makers Academy** December 2021 - April 2022

Intensive software engineering Bootcamp preparing me to return to John Lewis with a Full-Stack development skillset.


By attending Makers I have gained confidence in multiple languages and frameworks used in web development.

I learnt object-orientated design principles and how to utilise Test Driven Development.

Makers encourages problem solving and learning independently. Group projects and pair programming are used to show that communication and teamwork will achieve positive results.
